CODE:
##############################
LOGIC:
//first count unmatched bits.
  ///here we check 3 conditions,if our unmatched bits is >K then not possible.
        ///else if we have count<K ie we have K-count moves left now.Now we have two cases
        ///if length of string is odd then we can use these K-count on mid ele and string remains palindrome
        ///eg we have 10101 and K=8 ,now here count=0 so we use8 operations on mid as 10001 and 10101 is also
        ///palindrome. and if our length of string is even.then if we have even operation left then only we can make
        // palindrome else no. eg 101010 ,k=5,left=5, here  after 1 swap we get 101110 which is not palin,so after next swap
        ///we again get 101010 which is palindrome.
